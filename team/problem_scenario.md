John Doe recently graduated from UCSB, and while he is moving out of his apartment, he is left with an insurmountable amount of old textbooks, furniture, notes, etc. He would like to sell some of this stuff in order to get some money back, but current resources like Facebook Marketplace make it difficult to find buyers who are looking for these types of items, due to the fact that Facebook users don't primarily use Facebook to buy/sell items. Hence, John Doe wants a product like GauchoShare that will allow him to buy/sell items exclusively to other UCSB students who have the same desires. John Doe will ultimately want GauchoShare to make it easier to buy/sell items with other UCSB students compared to the current available options.
