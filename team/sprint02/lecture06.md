Profile UI page prototype design is finished, but the user authentication is still not working. Search function frontend is finished, so the next step will be to implement the backend for this feature.

Backend team will continue trying to solve issues with user authentication using Google and Facebook, and try to connect to the Profile UI Page once that is set up.
